Last updated: 2026-01-26Z (Editing Safety & Discovery)

## Current focus

- System Prompt Updates (Safety):
  - Enforced "Load-Before-Edit" rule: never edit unloaded files known only via meta.
  - Defined "Discovery Protocol" for broad prompts (use state/scratch to explore).

## Next step

- Resume TypeDoc coverage for library API (`src/**`).
