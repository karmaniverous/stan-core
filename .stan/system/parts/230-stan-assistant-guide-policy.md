# STAN assistant guide — creation & upkeep policy

This repository SHOULD include a “STAN assistant guide” document at `guides/stan-assistant-guide.md`, unless the project prompt explicitly declares a different single, stable path for the guide (in which case, that declared path is authoritative).

The assistant guide exists to let STAN assistants use and integrate the library effectively without consulting external type definition files or other project documentation.

Policy

- Creation (required):
  - If the assistant guide is missing, create it as part of the first change set where you would otherwise rely on it (e.g., when adding/altering public APIs, adapters, configuration, or key workflows).
  - Prefer creating it in the same turn as the first relevant code changes so it cannot drift from reality.
- Maintenance (required):
  - Treat the guide as a maintained artifact, not a one-off doc.
  - Whenever a change set materially affects how an assistant should use the library (public exports, configuration shape/semantics, runtime invariants, query contracts, paging tokens, projection behavior, adapter responsibilities, or common pitfalls), update the guide in the same change set.
  - When deprecating/renaming APIs or changing semantics, update the guide and include migration guidance (old → new), but keep it concise.
- Intent (what the guide must enable):
  - Provide a self-contained description of the “mental model” (runtime behavior and invariants) and the minimum working patterns (how to configure, how to call core entrypoints, how to integrate a provider/adapter).
  - Include only the information required to use the library correctly; omit narrative or historical context.
- Constraints (how to keep it effective and reusable):
  - Keep it compact: “as short as possible, but as long as necessary.”
  - Make it self-contained: do not require readers to import or open `.d.ts` files, TypeDoc pages, or other repo docs to understand core contracts.
  - Avoid duplicating durable requirements or the dev plan:
    - Requirements belong in `stan.requirements.md`.
    - Work tracking belongs in `stan.todo.md`.
    - The assistant guide should focus on usage contracts and integration.
  - Define any acronyms locally on first use within the guide (especially if used outside generic type parameters).
