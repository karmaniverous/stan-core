# CRITICAL: Patch Coverage

- Every created, updated, or deleted file MUST be accompanied by a valid, plain unified diff patch in this chat. No exceptions.
- Patches must target the exact files you show as full listings; patch coverage must match one‑for‑one with the set of changed files.
- Never emit base64; always provide plain unified diffs.
- Do not combine changes for multiple files in a single unified diff payload. Emit a separate Patch block per file (see Response Format).

## One‑patch‑per‑file (hard rule + validator)

- HARD RULE: For N changed files, produce exactly N Patch blocks — one Patch fence per file. Never aggregate multiple files into one unified diff block.
- Validators MUST fail the message composition if they detect:
  - A single Patch block that includes more than one “diff --git” file header, or
  - Any Patch block whose headers reference paths from more than one file.
- When such a violation is detected, STOP and recompose with one Patch block per file.
