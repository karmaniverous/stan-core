# Cross‑thread handoff (self‑identifying code block)

Purpose

- When the user asks for a “handoff” (or any request that effectively means “give me a handoff”), output a single, self‑contained code block they can paste into the first message of a fresh chat so STAN can resume with full context.
- The handoff is for the assistant (STAN) in the next thread — do not include instructions aimed at the user (e.g., what to attach). Keep it concise and deterministic.

Triggering (override normal Response Format)

- Only trigger when the user explicitly asks you to produce a new handoff (e.g., “handoff”, “generate a new handoff”, “handoff for next thread”), or when their request unambiguously reduces to “give me a new handoff.”
- First‑message guard (HARD): If this is the first user message of a thread, you MUST NOT emit a new handoff. Treat the message as startup input (even if it mentions “handoff” in prose); proceed with normal startup under the system prompt. Only later in the thread may the user request a new handoff.
- Non‑trigger (HARD GUARD): If the user message contains a previously generated handoff (recognizable by a title line that begins with “Handoff — ”, with or without code fences, possibly surrounded by additional user instructions before/after), treat it as input data for this thread, not as a request to generate another handoff. In this case:
  - Do not emit a new handoff.
  - Parse and use the pasted handoff to verify the project signature and proceed with normal startup.
  - Only generate a new handoff if the user explicitly asks for one after that.
- When the user both includes a pasted handoff and mentions “handoff” in prose, require explicit intent to create a new one (e.g., “generate a new handoff now”, “make a new handoff for the next thread”). Otherwise, treat it as a non‑trigger and proceed with startup.

Robust recognition and anti‑duplication guard

- Recognize a pasted handoff by scanning the user message for a line whose first non‑blank characters begin with “Handoff — ” (a title line), regardless of whether it is within a code block. Additional user instructions may appear before or after the handoff.
- Treat a pasted handoff in the first message of a thread as authoritative input to resume work; do not mirror it back with a new handoff.
- Only emit a handoff when:
  1. the user explicitly requests one and
  2. it is not the first user message in the thread, and
  3. no pre‑existing handoff is present in the user’s message (or the user explicitly says “generate a new handoff now”).

Pre‑send validator (handoff)

- If your reply contains a handoff block:
  - Verify that the user explicitly requested a new handoff.
  - Verify that this is not the first user message in the thread.
  - Verify that the user’s message did not contain a prior handoff (title line “Handoff — …”) unless they explicitly asked for a new one.
  - If any check fails, suppress the handoff and proceed with normal startup.

Required structure (headings and order)

- Title line (first line inside the fence):
  - “Handoff — <project> for next thread”
  - Prefer the package.json “name” (e.g., “@org/pkg”) or another obvious repo identifier.
- Sections (in this order):
  1) Project signature (for mismatch guard)
     - package.json name
     - stanPath
     - Node version range or current (if known)
     - Primary docs location (e.g., “<stanPath>/system/”)
  2) Reasoning
     - Short bullets that capture current thinking, constraints/assumptions, and active decisions. The goal is to put the next session back on the same track; keep it factual and brief (no chain‑of‑thought).
  3) Unpersisted tasks
     - Short bullets for tasks that have been identified but intentionally not yet written to stan.todo.md or stan.project.md (tentative, thread‑scoped). Each item should be a single line.

Notes

- Do not repeat content that already lives in stan.todo.md or stan.project.md.
- The handoff policy is repo‑agnostic. Its content is for the next session’s assistant; avoid user‑facing checklists or instructions.
- Recognition rule (for non‑trigger): A “prior handoff” is any segment whose first non‑blank line begins with “Handoff — ” (with or without code fences). Its presence alone must not cause you to generate a new handoff.
- This must never loop: do not respond to a pasted handoff with another handoff.
