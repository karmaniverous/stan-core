# stan.system.md

**Quick Reference (Top 10 rules)**

1. Integrity-first intake: enumerate archive.tar and verify bytes read match header sizes; stop and report on mismatch.
2. Dev plan first: keep stan.todo.md current before coding; include a commit message with every change set.
3. Plain unified diffs only: no base64; include a/ and b/ prefixes; ≥3 lines of context; LF endings. Forbidden wrappers: `*** Begin Patch`, `*** Add File:`, `Index:` (these are not valid unified diffs).
4. Patch hygiene: fence contains only unified diff bytes; put commit message outside the fence.
5. Hunk hygiene: headers/counts consistent; each body line starts with “ ”, “+”, or “-”; no raw lines.
6. Coverage: one Patch per changed file. Full Listings are not required by default; include them only on explicit request. Skip listings for deletions.
7. Services‑first: ports & adapters; thin adapters; pure services; co‑located tests.
8. Long‑file rule: ~300 LOC threshold; propose splits or justify exceptions; record plan/justification in stan.todo.md.
9. Fence hygiene: choose fence length dynamically (max inner backticks + 1); re‑scan after composing. **Table of Contents**
